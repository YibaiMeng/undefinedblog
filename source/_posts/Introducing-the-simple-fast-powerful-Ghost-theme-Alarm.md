**update**

The theme is completely customizable now by using `Grunt`, check it out! 

------------

Ever since I migrate my blog from `Wordpress` to `Ghost`, there is one thing bothers me all the time: the theme. Yeah I heard you, Ghost is a blogging platform, we should focus on what we write, blah blah blah. So,  we should not care about how it looks anymore? Are you listening to your self!

Anyway, I build this simple but powerful Ghost theme `Alarm` to suit my need, if to any extend it attracts you I might be happy.

 
```javascript
//let's mess up with some code
var code = {
	high: true
};
//neat, huh?
//Try click on the table of content area on the left
```

##Features

 - Super simple and super fast, less than 20KB to load the index page
 - Powerful add-ons like `Disqus comment`, `Google Analytics`, `Syntax Highlighting`, `Table of content` are ready to use and **customizable**, which means you can easily ditch it if you're not cool with it
 - Fully responsive, works like a charm in any mobile platform
 - Legacy browser support, yeah I mean IE8
 - Google search integrated
 - Remember, with all these awesome features, `Alarm` is small &  simple & fast
 - Static pages in nav menu support, automatically! Try click the nav menu on this page and play around

##I want it

Head over my [Github repo](https://github.com/jasonslyvia/alarm) to download this theme. Then customize for you own need, like:

 - Change `Disqus` and `Google Analytics` code, which locates in `alarm/partials`
 - Modify the nav menu(if you change the amount of menu items, remember change the corresponding stylesheet or you will get a messed up nav menu in mobile platform)
 
##Roadmap

 - [x] Better SEO support
 - [ ] Name whatever you want and whatever I can do
